        My name is Attila Bionki, I am currently an undergraduate at University of California, Riverside, majoring in Business Administration. I am a passionate individual hungry for knowledge constantly learning inside and outside the classroom environment. I love networking and seeking out other like-minded individuals who are driven toward their own goals and have experience in fields that I am not familiar with as I feel like I can learn from others as well and become very well-diversified and comfortable with different, unique environments. I began many ventures and became very familiarized with different forms of business from a young age.
<br><br>

        I first became a businessman with nothing but a T-shirt. In 9th grade, I realized the business possibilities of reselling exclusive, in-demand shoes and clothes, and made the purchase to sell for a high return. After researching trends, I started buying products that my school and community found fashionably appealing using the profit. Eventually, I established enough connections to build a partnership with a San Diego organization that received high-demand sneakers weeks prior to release, helping me create a large profit margin in a short amount of time. More importantly than the money earned, however, Iâ€™ve gained insight into business management, accounting, and marketing, along with planning my goal of opening my own clothing company. To develop the skills needed, I took classes on activities such as photography, an integral part of marketing apparel. Once I became proficient, I transformed my photography skills into another business, taking pictures for my communityâ€™s family, dance, and graduation events. I also began taking photos of sports games for my schoolâ€™s website, practicing my skills in a professional setting.
<br><br>
When I first picked up a camera in high school and immediately fell in love with the art of capturing a moment in time and began seeking out people who require assistance in capturing their moments. I have amassed experience in taking photos in sporting events, student graduations, nature, family portraits, lifestyle, and many more! I have amassed a lot of experience with using Adobe applications, especially Photoshop and Lightroom. I am seeking out new opportunities and experiences to take my skills to the next level.
<br><br>
Currently I am now pursuing a license in real estate to purchase and sell horses and eventually develop a real estate portfolio. Over the past 2 years I have fully invested my time in creating assets within the stock market and I plan to expand my horizons and begin creating another asset portfolio in real estate specifically commercial real estate. Commercial real estate is a field I can see myself placing a great deal of capital in investing with high returns as well to create more opportunities in other aspirations I have.
<br><br>
Other experiences Iâ€™ve gained are the importance of pushing beyond my comfort zone when reaching out to partners and managing money efficiently. However, as much as Iâ€™ve learned so far, there is so much more to learn in the world of business. As I continue my journey in college, I hope to continue establishing communication skills, investing time into starting a company, and learning the finer details of business in an academic setting.
